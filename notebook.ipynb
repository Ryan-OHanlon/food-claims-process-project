The first thing I did was remove the letters and special characters from the claim amount field so that the values could be used as a numeric data type according to the data set description. I also replaced any empty rows in the Cause field with the value ‘unknown’ so that the only causes listed would be ‘vegetables’, ‘meat’, and ‘unknown’. There were 78 rows that had null values that were replaced with the value ‘unknown’. Finally, I also removed one observation from the data as the time to close was listed at -57. After performing the requested validation, here is an overview of each field.\n\n- There is a total of 97 individual claims\n- The minimum number of days it took for a claim to be closed is 29 days, and the maximum number of days it took for a claim to be closed is 3591 days\n- The minimum claim amount value is 3,555, and the maximum claim amount value is 936,540\n- The minimum amount paid after the claim closed is 999.68, and the maximum amount paid after the claim closed is 558,725.77\n- The location field has the 4 locations of each claim office being:\n    - Recife\n    - Sao Luis\n    - Fortaleza\n    - Natal\n- The minimum number of individuals on a claim is 0, and the maximum number of individuals on a claim is 41.\n- There are two values for the linked cases field - true/false\n- The cause field has 3 types of food poisoning injuries:\n    - Meat\n    - Vegetable\n    - Unknown","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"d1b1a012-1ccb-40e7-a1ad-77b60b256690","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Data Discovery and Visualization\n\n### How does the number of claims differ across locations?\n\nThere are four possible locations included in this data. the Sao Luis location has the most amount of claims, with Recife being the second. The biggest difference of the amount of claims between the Sao Luis location and the Natal location is 8 claims. This shows that each office is handling about the same amount of claims.\n\n![Count by location](Count_ClaimsLocation.png)\n\n### What is the distribution of time to close claims?\n\nWhile each location is handling about the same number of claims, we need to look at the distribution of time it takes to close claims. Looking at each claim, we can see that most claims are closed within 1000 days, while the remaining claims range between 1000 and 2000 days to close. There are a couple outliers where claims have taken about and over 3000 days to close the claim. It is important to find out if the outliers where the time to close claims are across all locations or held by a single location.\n\n![Range of claims by Time to close](Range_ClaimsTimetoclose.png)\n\n### How does the average time to close claims differ by location?\n\nFinally, we want to combine the location field with the time to close field and see how long each location takes to close claims.\n\nWhen looking at each location individually, we can see that the Natal location is able to close claims the fastest compared to the other locations when looking at the average, as well as the interquartile range. Though it should be noted that Natal has the least amount of claims compared to the other locations.\n\nIn contrast, the Sao Luis location has the most amount of claims to close but also takes the longest and shortest amount of time to close claims based on the whiskers showing the maximum and minimum time to close claims. To reduce the amount of time it takes to close claims the legal team should investigate the Sao Luis location to determine why the time to close claims has the largest variance. \n\nThe other locations each have their own outliers each having claims that have taken over 2000 days to close to see what impacted closing the claim by the cause or the number of individuals linked to that claim.\n\n![Averages Time to Close by Location](Boxplot_Location_Timetoclose.png)","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"714a7083-7a43-4b0b-8ed4-2675efc87691","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
